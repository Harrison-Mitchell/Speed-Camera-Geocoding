# Speed-Camera-Geocoding
Translates speed camera location descriptions to coordinates and then displays them on a map.

### Usage
Get a GMaps API key, stick it in the `index.html` where `<KEY HERE>` is and also in the input box. Then open the camera list, select the whole table (including header) under `Fixed speed cameras` and paste it in the respective box. Repeat for school zone and red light cameras. Wait 2-3 minutes for the GeoCoding API to find coordinates, you can see the progress in the tab title. (For clearer help, watch `usage.mp4`).
